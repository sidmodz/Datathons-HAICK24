# Datathons-HAICK24
HAICK24 was an exciting 2-day datathon organized by the School of AI club. This event showcased the power of Artificial Intelligence through diverse challenges with real-world applications. Bringing together over 60 brilliant students from across the country, 15 teams competed fiercely on 5 challenging problems, collaborating, learning, and innovating to push the boundaries of AI solutions.

This repository documents some of my contributions developed during HAICK24.
